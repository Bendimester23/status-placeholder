# Status Placeholder
Super minimal, blazingly fast Minecraft Status Placeholder Server written in Rust(ğŸš€).

Have you ever wanted a Minecraft server, that only responds to Server List Ping? Me neither, but I made it anyway.
It is written in Rust(ğŸš€), so it is blazingly fast. Config is self-explanatory.
